# ChessTrophies — Project state (snapshot)

**Last updated:** 2026-06-07 — **MULTI-AGENT QA-AUDIT FIXES + REAL PUZZLES (Lichess-backed).** Ran a 5-lens QA audit (principal eng / QA / chess domain expert / product-UX / casual user), then fanned out 5 agents to fix the prioritized list. All 22 test suites green. **(1) Billing money-path correctness** (`server/billing.js`): the webhook now `await`s `handleEvent` and returns **500 on failure** so Stripe retries (previously it ACKed 200 then processed detached — a restart could permanently drop a paid premium flip); revenue is now recorded from **exactly one event type** (`invoice.payment_succeeded`) instead of also `checkout.session.completed` (which double/triple-counted every new subscriber's first charge ~2-3x in the admin revenue dashboard); pinned Stripe `apiVersion: '2024-06-20'`; added a prod `event.livemode` guard. **(2) REAL interactive puzzles** replacing the fake scripted single-move "daily lesson" (which forced the only correct move so you could never get it wrong): self-hosted **Lichess CC0** model — `server/puzzles.js` (`GET /api/puzzles/daily` deterministic by UTC date, `/next?rating=`, `POST /solved` auth-gated streak), `server/import-puzzles.mjs` (Lichess puzzle-CSV importer = the scale-up path to millions), `server/puzzle-seed.mjs` (**28 chess.js-verified** seed puzzles derived from the 60 python-verified academy lessons, so it works today with zero download), puzzle-progress persistence in `db.js`/`db-pg.js`/`store.js` (`puzzle_solves` idempotent + `puzzle_streaks`). Client `puzzles.js` (`window.CT_Puzzles`) implements **PUNISH-THEN-RETRY**: a wrong move makes the engine play the refutation (you feel the consequence), then Undo/Retry. The **daily streak is now earned by SOLVING the daily puzzle** (replaced the passive "opened a game" streak). `test/puzzles.mjs`. **Scale-up TODO:** run `node server/import-puzzles.mjs <lichess_db_puzzle.csv>` to grow past the 28-seed corpus. **(3) Checkers ACF rule fix** (`checkers.js`): **BLACK moves first in 8×8 ACF** (was wrongly using the International/FMJD white-first convention — the headline ranked mode literally had the wrong starting player); FMJD 10×10 stays white-first via a per-variant `firstMove` flag; the ACF 40-move no-progress draw now counts **per-side** (~80 plies) instead of declaring draws at half length. Tests updated (engine/online/friend). **(4) Client UX overhaul** (`app.js`/`index.html`/`ct-auth.js`): fixed the **BLOCKER funnel dead-end** — "Play now" and guest "Casual" now **start a game** instead of a jarring native `confirm()` about ranked; **premium copy is now driven by `billingCfg.enabled`** (killed the "$4.99/mo button over 'free preview / coming soon' copy" contradiction that showed at the moment of payment); lobby leads with the working mode when ranked is off; ad slots + "Remove ads" upsell hidden until ≥1 game finished; bottom nav 7→5 (Settings folded into Profile); **centralized 401 handling** → re-login prompt on all data paths + socket (previously friends/progress/socket silently swallowed expiry and stranded users); dropped `user-scalable=no` + `defer`red scripts; optional skill/region at signup; guest "create an account to keep your progress" CTA after first win; wired a "🧩 Today's Challenge" lobby card + Puzzles nav to `CT_Puzzles`. **(5) Build/SW correctness** (`scripts/build.mjs`/`sw.js`): the SW precache list is now derived from the **real dist tree** (was precaching `app.js`/`academy.js` which the bundler folds into `app.bundle.js` and never emits → 404 → atomic `addAll` nuked the whole precache → offline was dead); `CACHE` is stamped per deploy so `activate` evicts stale caches; precache is now resilient (`Promise.allSettled`); and the synthesized `app.bundle.js` `<script>` now inherits `defer` (it was executing synchronously *before* its now-deferred deps and throwing). **STILL TODO:** activate the Stripe **Customer Portal** in the Dashboard (for in-app cancel/manage). — Earlier (2026-06-07): **STRIPE BILLING IS LIVE — real payments working end-to-end.** Verified with a real live-mode purchase: Upgrade → Stripe Checkout → payment → webhook (`checkout.session.completed`) → `is_premium` flipped → ads removed. Setup that got it live: created the **live** webhook endpoint (`<APP_URL>/api/billing/webhook`) in the Stripe Dashboard and set Railway env `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (sk_live), `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (pk_live), `APP_URL=https://www.playchesstrophies.com`. **Two gotchas hit + fixed:** (1) `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` was initially set to a literal dollar amount instead of a `price_...` object id → checkout 502'd (`The price parameter should be the ID of a price object`); fixed by using the recurring price's `price_...` id. (2) `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` added to `server/server.js` (commit `c0832d4`) — behind Railway's proxy, express-rate-limit was throwing `ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR`. **Still TODO before relying on cancel/manage:** activate the Stripe **Customer Portal** (Dashboard → Settings → Billing → Customer portal) — the "Manage subscription" button calls `/api/billing/portal`, which 502s until the portal is activated once. Architecture note: game is served by **Vercel** at `www.playchesstrophies.com` (cross-origin to the Railway API); CORS already allow-lists the domain (`DEFAULT_WEB_ORIGINS` in server.js). — Earlier (2026-06-07): **STRIPE BILLING + CHECKERS MOVE ANIMATION + FRIEND-CHECKERS BUTTON** (branch `stripe-checkers-anim-friend`): **(1) Checkers move animation** — checkers moves used to teleport (a triple-jump applied instantly); now the moving piece slides across the board and multi-jumps hop through each landing, fading each captured piece as it's passed. Implemented entirely in `ct-checkers.js` (`animateMove(move, done)` re-parents the real piece into an absolute float, transitions `transform` per hop using the engine move's `path`/`captures`; engine STATE stays synchronous so tests/logic are unaffected — animation is purely visual). Degrades to instant render when the board isn't visible / reduced-motion / data missing. Tapping during a slide flushes the animation (never swallowed). Gated by new `test/checkers-anim.mjs` (brute-forces a real double-jump, asserts the float steps through ≥2 hops + both pieces removed). **(2) Stripe subscription billing** (Stripe-hosted Checkout redirect, fully env-gated, inert until configured): new `server/billing.js` (`/api/billing/config|checkout|portal|webhook`; webhook mounted with `express.raw` BEFORE `express.json()` for signature verification), `payments` ledger + `stripe_customer_id`/`subscription_status` columns + `revenueStats()` in db.js/db-pg.js/store.js, `is_premium` flipped by webhook (`checkout.session.completed`/`invoice.paid`/`subscription.deleted|updated`, idempotent on event id). Client (`app.js`): `fetchBillingConfig()` + `startCheckout()`/`openBillingPortal()`; the Premium modal's buy/cancel buttons hit Stripe when `billingCfg.enabled`, else fall back to the demo toggle; `handleBillingReturn()` polls `/api/me` after `?billing=success` to activate Premium. **Railway env to set:** `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` (recurring), `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, optional `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`; webhook URL `<APP_URL>/api/billing/webhook`; **`server` needs `npm i`/Docker rebuild** (new `stripe` dep). Gated by `test/billing.mjs`. **(3) Admin revenue analytics** — `/api/admin/stats` now returns `revenueMonthCents`/`revenueYearCents`/`revenueAllTimeCents`/`activeSubscribers`/`currency`; `admin.html` shows Revenue · month/year/to-date cards (formatted from cents). **(4) Clearer friend challenge** — each friend row now has explicit **♟ Chess** and **⛀ Checkers** buttons (`startFriendChess`/`startFriendCheckers` via `selectFriendById`) instead of only a modal. All suites green (incl. checkers-anim, billing, build-smoke, csp). — Earlier (2026-06-07): **CASUAL ONLINE PLAY + REPEATABLE TROPHIES + RANKINGS INTEGRITY** (branch `casual-play-trophies-rankings`): Added unrated **"Play online — Casual"** matchmaking for **chess 1v1** (`#btn-find-casual` → `startOnlineOrFakeMatchmaking('casual')`) and **checkers** (`#ck-btn-find-casual` → `CT_Checkers_UI.startFindCasual`). The server already accepted `mode:'casual'` (ungated, `rated:false`) but no UI ever sent it, so with ranked off there was *no* online "for fun" option. Casual is never gated by the seasonal ranked switch and never touches ELO/wins/streaks/trophies (matches the server's `mode==='ranked'`/`cg.rated` guards). 2v2 stays ranked-only. **Trophies are now repeatable with an earned-counter**: streak trophies + single-game feats (fast wins, underpromotion, shutout, triple-jump, …) re-earn and show an `×N` badge (`achievementCount`/`awardAchievement`, `repeatable:true` in trophy-data.js); cumulative milestones (total wins/games/rating/checkmates/invites) stay one-time. Repeatable awards only count on the FINAL post-game pass (`ctx.finalize`) so the two-phase chess result flow can't double-count; legacy saves (no `count`) read as 1 and keep counting. The **Checkers** trophy collection already rendered (auto-grouped by family) and is earnable in ranked checkers; its feats also fire in casual. **Rankings now list participants only** — `topByMetric` (db.js + db-pg.js) filters by a fixed per-metric participation map (elo→`wins+losses+draws>0`, wins→`wins>0`, streak→`best_streak>0`, trophies→count>0, checkers8/10→new `checkers8_games`/`checkers10_games` counters incremented in `finishCheckersGame` when rated); client mirrors the filter in its offline fallback + friendly empty-state. Checkers ELO confirmed a real separate system (elo_checkers_8/10, K=32, official ACF 8×8 rules); friend invites for chess AND checkers confirmed wired (Friends → tap friend → modal). New tests `test/rankings-participation.mjs` + `test/trophies-repeat.mjs` (both in CI); all 18 suites green. — Earlier (2026-06-07): **WENT WEB-ONLY**: removed the native/Capacitor (Android) layer entirely — deleted `android/`, `capacitor.config.json`, `www/`, `scripts/refresh-www.sh`/`.ps1`, `docs/ANDROID_BUILD.md`, and the 4 `@capacitor/*` deps. ChessTrophies is now strictly a website (desktop + mobile web): Vercel serves the client (`npm run build:dist` → `dist/`), Railway serves the API; the **PWA stays** (`sw.js` + `manifest.json`) so mobile users can still "Add to Home Screen" with offline support. `config.js` simplified to web-only origin routing (off-origin Vercel client → Railway API; same-origin/local-dev unset). `ct-ads.js` reduced to a web no-op shim (native AdMob removed; in-page ad slots remain for AdSense). To re-add an app store later: `npx cap init` + `npx cap add android` and reintroduce the www refresh. NOTE: tables/inventory below still mention the Android app/`www`/refresh scripts — those are historical now. — Earlier (2026-06-06): **multi-perspective QA audit + fixes** (branch `audit-fixes`, pushed; not yet merged to `main`). Ran a 5-lens audit (principal engineer, QA, chess domain expert, product/UX, casual user), then implemented the findings: **(security/backend)** server now allowlists the client `mode` so it decides ranked-vs-casual (closed an ELO-integrity hole), safe CORS default + prod warning, verification-code resend rate-limited, avatar data-URLs validated, graceful shutdown + global error handlers. **(engine/review)** quiescence now handles being in check, mate-distance scoring, removed the random-capture sabotage (replaced with principled depth/noise/slack weakening), root alpha-beta in `bestMove`, unified review eval + softened "likely blunder/mistake" labels + honest exponential accuracy. **(content)** fixed lesson SK04 (Nf6+ only) and EG02 (real Qc5 boxing), precise opposition wording, corrected lesson count 115→60. **(frontend)** stripped stale demo/Phase-2 copy, honest guest ranked CTA (no fake search), lead-with-Play onboarding, deduped buttons, socket.io CDN fallback, SW update prompt (guarded vs first-visit reload), localStorage write guards, PNG/maskable icons, safe-area-top. **(new features)** **Daily Challenge + streak** retention loop (`daily-challenge.js`, reuses the 60 verified lessons, rides `/api/progress` sync); **PostgreSQL persistence tier** (`server/store.js` + `server/db-pg.js`, async facade, SQLite default / Postgres when `DB_BACKEND=postgres` (+ `DATABASE_URL`) — opt-in flag, NOT on bare DATABASE_URL since Railway auto-injects it; live-game write path fully converted — PE-M1 closed); **real Chess960 castling** (`CT_960Castle` in `chess960.js`, human + engine, mode re-enabled) gated by `test/chess960-castle.mjs` (46 assertions) + `test/chess960-ai-castle.mjs` (32). All suites green: smoke-2v2, verify, rankings, review-eval, both chess960 tests, lessons 60/60. **(CSP)** hardened **script-src** to `'self' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com` (dropped `'unsafe-inline'`): externalized the 4 inline `<script>` blocks (`ct-onerror.js`, `ct-chess-check.js`, `ct-socket-fallback.js`, `ct-sw-register.js`) and converted all 21 inline `on*` handlers to `addEventListener`/delegation, gated by `test/csp.mjs` (Playwright, 0 script-src violations + handlers verified). style-src intentionally keeps `'unsafe-inline'` (many dynamic inline `style=` attributes). **(build)** added `npm run build:dist` (esbuild, `scripts/build.mjs`) → minified `dist/` web bundle (39% smaller JS; tail app/academy/daily/review/trophy-extras/learn-library concatenated into `app.bundle.js`, ct-ai.js/chess960.js kept standalone for the Worker), gated by `test/build-smoke.mjs` (boots + flows + worker path + 0 CSP violations). Deploy: Vercel build command `npm run build:dist`, output dir `dist`. Not wired into `refresh-www.sh` (native uses readable source + string-matching patches). **Still open:** regenerate `www/` (`bash scripts/refresh-www.sh`) once Android Studio releases the folder lock. — Earlier (2026-06-04): switched email verification to a **6-digit code** (authenticated + per-user, throttled to 5 tries, 1h expiry) instead of a link; added a startup log of the email-provider state. NOTE: emails still only send once `RESEND_API_KEY`/`RESEND_FROM`/`APP_URL` are configured on Railway. Earlier: fixed the **rankings leaderboard only showing yourself + local guests**: it read the per-device DB instead of the server. Now `/api/rankings` is the source (all metrics incl. computed Trophies), with a local fallback only for guests/offline (`npm run test:rankings`). Earlier: added Open Graph share banner; removed the **entire Puzzles tab** (puzzles were inaccurate; files + CI step deleted, nav/UI cleaned up); expanded the **Learn library to 43 articles** (25 new, all fact-checked — fixed 2 errors in existing ones: opposition odd→even, luft = rook's pawn); fixed the **friend-add "no user on this device" bug** (longer auth timeout so Railway cold starts don't strand users in a tokenless offline session; honest offline/guest messaging instead of a useless local lookup). Earlier: removed the Daily puzzle mode; added engine-backed game analysis/review (eval bar + eval graph + blunder detection with best-move hints; `npm run test:review` guards it in CI) and, earlier, soft email verification on signup (non-blocking nudge + verify link/code + resend; `npm run test:verify`). Earlier the same day: big push since 06-01: game clocks (now simplified to one timed + untimed), rematch/disconnect-reconnect UX, Redis-backed multi-instance scaling for online play, password reset + change password, progress sync to the server, server-backed friends with friend-request consent + block + in-game opponent avatars, AdMob banner scaffold, Android release signing, computer AI moved to a Web Worker, and a rebuilt academy curriculum. Client split into focused modules (`ct-ai.js`, `ct-auth.js`, `ct-duo.js`, `trophy-data.js`, `ct-ads.js`, `ct-ai-worker.js`).

## What exists right now

### Built and verified working

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Email/password auth | ✓ Done — local + server endpoints |
| Password reset + change password | ✓ Done — `/api/auth` reset flow with email delivery (`server/email.js`) + in-app change password |
| Email verification on signup | ✓ Done — **soft (non-blocking)**: signup emails a **6-digit code**; the user types it into the in-app banner/modal. Verify is authenticated + per-user, throttled (5 wrong tries burn the code), 1h expiry, resend supported. `/api/me` exposes `emailVerified`; unverified users can still play. **Email only sends when `RESEND_API_KEY`+`RESEND_FROM`+`APP_URL` are set on the backend** (startup logs say which). Tested by `npm run test:verify` (in CI) |
| Cross-device progress sync | ✓ Done — `/api/progress` deep-merges puzzle/lesson state + max counters so progress follows the account, not the browser |
| Player profiles with stats | ✓ Done |
| Pass-and-play PvP (same device) | ✓ Done |
| Skill-based matchmaking (±100 ELO) | ✓ Done |
| Online ranked 1v1 (real opponents) | ✓ Done — wired to Railway server via Socket.IO (Phase 2). Required the 2026-06-01 JWT-drop fix to actually connect (see Verification note) |
| Online ranked 2v2 team chess | ✓ Done — solo queue or friend duo, server pairs four players into two teams, 3-min queue, separate 2v2 ELO, server-authoritative moves. **Multi-device (4-client) end-to-end verified 2026-06-01** (see Verification note below) |
| Game clocks (time controls) | ✓ Done — server-authoritative clocks for online 1v1 + 2v2. **Simplified 2026-06-04** from 6 options to two: one standard timed control (10+0) + untimed, so a small queue isn't fragmented across buckets |
| Rematch + disconnect/reconnect (1v1) | ✓ Done — rematch offers after a finished game, disconnect-grace window + reconnect into a live game |
| Multi-instance scaling (Redis) | ✓ Done — Socket.IO Redis adapter + shared game/queue state, gated on `REDIS_URL`. 1v1, 2v2, duo invites, reconnect & rematch all work across server instances |
| Practice vs Computer (Easy/Med/Hard) | ✓ Done — built-in minimax with PSTs, quiescence, iterative deepening (≈1500-1700 ELO); search runs in a Web Worker so the UI never freezes |
| Game analysis / review | ✓ Done — post-game **Review** opens an engine-backed analysis: per-move accuracy %, Best→Blunder classification with "best: …" suggestions, an **eval bar** + per-move **eval graph**, navigable board. Reuses the built-in engine via new `CT_AI.evaluate`/`bestMove`; runs async with a progress %. Tested by `npm run test:review` (in CI) |
| 60 verified chess lessons | ✓ Done — every solution verified by python-chess |
| Lesson teaching + Watch Example demo | ✓ Done |

| 10 embarrassing fail trophies | ✓ Done |
| Recruiter trophy (invite friends) | ✓ Done |
| Tiered rankings (Top 100/500/5000/All-time, 4 metrics) | ✓ Done — **server-backed global leaderboard** via `/api/rankings` (ELO/Wins/Trophies/Streak). Guests/offline fall back to the per-device list. Guarded by `npm run test:rankings` |
| Friends list + add by username | ✓ Done — server-backed with username autocomplete/search, friend-request consent (no silent adds), and block-player |
| In-game opponent avatars | ✓ Done — opponent avatar/rank shown during online games |
| Friendly (non-ranked) challenge mode | ✓ Done |
| Private room codes | ✓ Done |
| Invite & Share modal with link + native share | ✓ Done |
| Ads framework (Banner + Medium Rectangle) | ✓ Placeholders ready for AdSense/AdMob |

### Verification — 2v2 changes (2026-06-01)

Removal of the "Practice 2v2 (vs AI)" mode and the corny RANKED 2v2 copy was **verified PASS** by driving the real web client in headless Chromium (Playwright, guest login → lobby):

- Front page shows only the **RANKED 2v2** card — no "Practice 2v2 (vs AI)" card, no corny description paragraph.
- `window.Duo` API no longer exposes `startPractice`/`startRanked`; `duoPickMove` is gone; no `pageerror`/ReferenceError from the removed AI code.
- "Find ranked 2v2" button still wired: clicking it fires `startOnlineTeamMatchmaking`, which correctly guards on the server connection.

### Verification — online play multi-device + JWT-drop bug fix (2026-06-01)

The earlier "successful online 2v2 match" gap was closed by running the **real backend locally** (throwaway SQLite DB) and driving **4 isolated browser sessions** (Playwright) through signup → queue → match → moves.

**Bug found (was breaking ALL online play):** the login and signup form handlers (`app.js`) called `setSession({ userId: u.id })` *after* `login()`/`signup()` had already stored `{ userId, token }`, overwriting the session and dropping the JWT. With no token, `connectGameSocketIfPossible()` bailed and the game socket never connected — so freshly authenticated users could never reach online 1v1 **or** 2v2. It went unnoticed because the REST signup loop (and the earlier single-player verify) don't exercise the socket. Marking online play "verified" before this was premature.

**Fix (commit `e590af9`):** merge into the existing session instead of replacing it — `setSession(Object.assign({}, getSession(), { userId: u.id }))` — so the server-auth token survives. Local/offline fallback paths stay intentionally tokenless. Propagated to `www/` via `scripts/refresh-www.sh`.

**Re-test against the fixed code (no patches) — PASS:** all 4 clients signup → socket-auth → server pairs them into one game with correct seats (w0/w1/b0/b1, identical start FEN) → 4 moves played by w/seat0 → b/seat0 → w/seat1 → b/seat1, each synced server-authoritatively across all four clients, zero page errors. Seat rotation and move sync confirmed working.

**Important:** Have these reviewed by a lawyer before going live with real money. They are solid templates but specific clauses (arbitration, refunds, liability caps) need to be adjusted to your business + jurisdiction.

## How to resume work

### Quick wins next session

1. **Buy the domain** (15 min, $10)
2. **Push to GitHub + deploy to Vercel** (15 min, free)
3. **Fill the placeholders in `privacy.html` and `terms.html`** (30 min)
4. **Set up `support@yourdomain.com` email** (10 min)
5. **Announce to friends + r/chess** (30 min)

That's the "go live" sequence. Total: ~2 hours, ~$10.

### Bigger next milestones

- **Wire the client to the backend server** (see `LAUNCH_GUIDE.md` Phase 2). This unlocks real online play across devices.
- **Apply to Google AdSense** once you have ~100 daily visitors.
- **Set up Stripe** for real Premium subscriptions.

### When you reconvene with me

Just say: "Read STATE.md and let's continue with X" — where X is whatever phase from `LAUNCH_GUIDE.md` you want to tackle. I'll pick up immediately without losing context.

## Known issues / things to watch

- **localStorage is per-origin** — accounts created at `file://` won't appear at `https://yoursite.com`. Users start fresh when you migrate to the real domain. (Acceptable for soft launch since you have no real users yet.)
- **chess.js is bundled (self-hosted)** — `chess.min.js` at the repo root IS the engine (classic chess.js 0.10.3), loaded locally with a fallback notice if it fails. **socket.io** is the one remaining CDN script (cdnjs); as of the audit it has a local fallback (`vendor/socket.io.min.js`, injected if cdnjs is blocked).
- **Persistence backends** — defaults to better-sqlite3 (zero-config). Set **`DB_BACKEND=postgres`** (+ `DATABASE_URL`) to use PostgreSQL (`server/db-pg.js`); the live-game write path is converted, so with Postgres on, multi-instance replicas no longer all funnel writes through one SQLite file. Postgres is opt-in via the explicit flag — **bare `DATABASE_URL` does NOT switch backends** (Railway/Render/Heroku auto-inject it, which would otherwise crash boot). SQLite path is unchanged and remains the test/default path.
- **CSP script-src is hardened** — `script-src 'self' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com` (no `'unsafe-inline'`); inline scripts externalized, inline handlers delegated, guarded by `npm`-less `node test/csp.mjs`. **style-src** still carries `'unsafe-inline'` on purpose (lots of dynamic inline `style=` attributes; hardening it is a separate CSS refactor). **Production build available** — `npm run build:dist` (esbuild) emits a minified `dist/` (39% smaller JS, order-safe tail concatenated into `app.bundle.js`, worker files kept standalone), verified by `node test/build-smoke.mjs`. Deploy on Vercel with build command `npm run build:dist` + output dir `dist`. The unminified repo root is still what's served until that Vercel setting is flipped; `refresh-www.sh` (native) intentionally stays on the readable source.
- **~~No email verification on signup~~** — DONE: soft verification. Signups still succeed and can play without confirming (so a missing email provider never blocks anyone); the client nudges them to verify. To actually deliver the emails set `RESEND_API_KEY` + `APP_URL` in prod. If you later want to *require* verification before ranked play, gate it behind a new env flag — intentionally not enforced yet.
- **~~No password reset~~** — DONE (06-02): reset + change-password flow with email delivery (`server/email.js`). Make sure the email provider/env is configured in production.
- **Trophy/puzzle progress now syncs server-side** for logged-in accounts via `/api/progress`. Guests/offline still keep progress per-browser, so clearing browser data wipes a guest's progress — mention in the launch FAQ.
- **Redis is optional but recommended at scale** — online play falls back to single-instance in-memory state when `REDIS_URL` is unset. Set it in production before running more than one server instance, or cross-instance matches/reconnects won't share state.
- **`www/` needs regenerating** — the audit-fixes branch changed many client files; run `bash scripts/refresh-www.sh` (now also copies `daily-challenge.js` + `vendor/`) to rebuild the Capacitor bundle + `npx cap sync` before the next Android build.
- **`audit-fixes` branch not yet merged** — all the 2026-06-06 work lives on `audit-fixes` (pushed to origin). Open/merge the PR when ready.
